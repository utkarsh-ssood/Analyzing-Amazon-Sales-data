# Amazon Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to identify trends, key metrics, and relationships between dataset attributes. It involves ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) operations and advanced visualizations to derive meaningful insights for improving sales management.

---

## Problem Statement
Sales management plays a critical role in optimizing business operations and profitability. By analyzing Amazon sales data, this project aims to:
- Perform ETL operations to preprocess and clean the data.
- Analyze sales trends on various time scales.
- Identify key metrics and meaningful relationships between dataset attributes.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI
- **Libraries/Packages:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- Order Date
- Sales Channel (Online/Offline)
- Item Type
- Region
- Units Sold
- Unit Price
- Unit Cost
- Total Revenue
- Total Cost
- Total Profit

---

## Approach

### ETL Process
1. **Extract:**
   - Load the dataset from the provided source.
   - Clean the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

2. **Transform:**
   - Data wrangling for extracting meaningful insights.
   - Aggregated values such as monthly revenue and yearly profit.
   - Normalize data for advanced analysis.

3. **Load:**
   - Save the processed data in a structured database or prepare it for visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI.

### Analysis and Visualization
- **Trends:** Analyze month-wise, year-wise, and yearly-month-wise sales trends using line charts and bar graphs.
- **Key Metrics:** Calculate total revenue, profit, and costs based on various attributes.
- **Relationships:** Identify correlations between sales channels, regions, and profitability using heatmaps, scatter plots, and stacked bar charts.

---

## Outputs and Findings
- **Trends:**
  - Insights into month-wise, year-wise sales trends.
  - Identification of high-performing and low-performing regions.

- **Key Metrics:**
  - Revenue and profit distribution by region, sales channel, and item type.
  - Contributions of sales channels (Online/Offline) to total revenue.

- **Relationships:**
  - Impact of item type on profitability.
  - Seasonal demand patterns influencing sales trends.
  - Regional influence on revenue and profit.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

  - Modular, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- **Visualization:**
  - Clear, interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations.
- **Project Report:**
  - Comprehensive explanation of methodology, findings, and tools used.
- **Creativity:**
  - Innovative use of tools and derivation of unique insights.

---

## Deliverables
1. **Code Submission:**
   - Python scripts for ETL, analysis, and visualization in PDF format.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Share Tableau Public links or Power BI project files.

3. **Report:**
   - Detailed project report covering problem statement, methodology, analysis, and conclusions.

---

## Running the Code
1. Install required Python libraries using `pip install` (e.g., `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`).
2. Run the ETL pipeline script to preprocess the data.
3. Use the analysis scripts to generate metrics and insights.
4. Visualize the processed data using Tableau or Power BI.
